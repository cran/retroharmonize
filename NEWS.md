# retroharmonize 0.1.11
Further issues with URLs, hopefully all resolved.

# retroharmonize 0.1.12
* In the examples, dontrun{} replaced by donttest{}.  
* Further clarity given in comment to the Eurobarometer vignette that some part of the code is not evaluated, as it shows how to work with a large number of files from GESIS that we have no permission to re-publish.  We show with examples how the user, after gaining permission from GESIS to download the files, and placing it into her working environment can efficiently subset these files.
